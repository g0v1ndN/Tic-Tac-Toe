## About:
Welcome to my Tic Tac Toe game, which I created during my free time to expand my knowledge of JavaScript. This project allowed me to dive deeper into JavaScript and learn how to create a dynamic and interactive web application. As a fan of simple games, I chose to make a Tic Tac Toe game, which is a classic game that I and everyone used to play during our childhood. Through building this game, I have learned about the core concepts of JavaScript, including arrays, loops, and functions. I have also learned about the power of event listeners to create interactive and responsive web applications.

## Features:
1. A div tag to contain the game board and eight divs with the class "box" and unique IDs to represent the individual squares.
2. Pseudo-classes to remove the right and bottom borders from the third and sixth boxes, respectively.
3. An array to represent the game board, initially filled with null values.
4. A function to add a click event listener to each box element and an event handler function to handle clicks on the boxes.
5. Conditional statements to check if the box has already been clicked.
6. Statements to update the game board, display the symbol of the current player, and check if the game has been won.
7. A variable to store an array of winning combinations.
8. A function to restart the game when the restart button is clicked.
